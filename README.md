# MWE_dataset_gl

# Description

This dataset comprises 240 noun-adjective multi-word expressions (MWEs) in Galician, which account for 322 different senses. For expressions and their constituents, we provide frequency, ambiguity, and productivity data. These expressions are contextualized in up to four examples that were extracted from corpora. Please note that there exist a shortage of around 6% of contexts, as no valid examples could be found in some instances.

Additionally, human judments on compositionality levels were obtained for all senses. Thus, mean compositionality scores for compounds, heads, and depedents are provided. These mean values come from 2 sets of ratings. We are currently increasing the number of ratings, which will also be released. The dataset can be found in dataset_noun_amod. More information about its content can be found in info.txt.
