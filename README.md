# MWE_dataset_gl

# Description

This dataset comprises 240 noun-adjective multi-word expressions (MWEs) in Galician. These expressions present different degrees of frequency in the language, compositionality levels, and semantic ambiguity, accounting for 323 senses overall. For each sense, the dataset includes two manually-created sentences (unknown to models), and four sentences extracted from corpora (known to models) that contextualize the expression.

MWEs are classified as compositional, partial, and Potentially Idiomatic Expressions (PIE), and their senses are disambiguated in compositional, partial, and idiomatic. In all defined senses, compositionality scores for the compound, head, and depedent of the MWEs are provided.
